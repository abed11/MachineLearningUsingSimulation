# MachineLearningUsingSimulation
Use Excel simulated data for queuing system to train Machine Learning models.

Excel was used to create a generator for M/M/1 queueing system data

3 different ML algorithms were compared to find one that provides the least error
Error Metrics used: Root Mean Squared Error
Other Metrics used: R squared value

Scikit-Learn Library was used to implement Machine Learning 

ML algorithms used: 
Random Forest Regressor
Support Vector Regressor
Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor
